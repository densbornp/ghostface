                        website and are pleased that you are interested in our website.
                        The protection of your personal data is important to us. Personal
                        data includes individual information about personal or objective
                        circumstances of a specific or definable individual person. This
                        includes information as e.g. the regular name, address, telephone
                        number and date of birth, e-mail-address or an IP-address. We
                        collect such data only insofar as technically necessary as such
                        data enjoys special protection. We would like to explain to you
                        hereafter – according to our obligation by law – which data will
                        be collected as you visit our homepage and how we use such data.
                        The way we handle your data is in accordance with the rules of the
                        EU-General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the Federal Data
                        Protection Act (BDSG) as well as the State Data Protection Act of
                        Rhineland-Palatine (LDSG).

                            purpose indicated. Processing of personal data of our users only
                            happens after we have received the individual user‘s consent.
                            This shall not apply if obtaining user’s prior consent is not
                            feasible for practical reasons and if the processing of data is
                            permitted by rule of law.

                                we will use such data only for the purpose covered by your
                                prior consent. Data storage beyond that purpose may be
                                possible if EU or national rules of law or other rules and
                                regulations which are binding for us, permit such storage. We
                                will respect your protection requiring interests according to
                                the rules of law.

                            established and machine-readable format. Additionally, you have
                            the right to transmit such data to another responsible person
                            without any hindrance by the responsible person whom you have
                            provided with your personal data, if<br />
                            - data processing is based on a consent according to Art. 6 sec.
                            1 lit. (a) GDPR or Art. 9 sec. 2 lit. (a) GDPR or on a contract
                            according to Art. 6 sec. 1 lit. (b) GDPR and<br />
                            - data processing takes place by means of automated procedures.
                            <p>
                                When exercising this right you have also the right to obtain
                                that your personal data will be transmitted directly from one
                                responsible person to another one if this is technically
                                feasible. Any freedoms or rights of other persons may not be
                                damaged by this.<br />
                                The right of data transferability does not apply for the
                                processing of personal data which is necessary for the
                                perception of a task which is in the public interest or in
                                exercise of public authority which has been delegated onto the
                                responsible person.

                                your specific situation at any time according to Art. 6 sec. 3
                                lit. (b) GDPR in connection with § 3 LDSG; this shall also
                                apply with respect to a profiling which is based on these
                                provisions.<br />
                                The responsible person does not process your personal data any
                                longer, unless he can prove compulsory reasons for the
                                processing requiring protection which – at the same time –
                                prevail your interests, rights and freedom or if the
                                procession serves the enforcement, exercise or defence of

                                You have the possibility to execute your right of objection in
