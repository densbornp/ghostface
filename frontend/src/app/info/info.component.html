      <p>To get a face detection resistant image you have to consider a couple of important points.</p>
      <p>The results of the different methods very a lot dependent of the image size and color.
        Before downloading the new image it is highly recommended to test the resistancy against all
        available cascades. Each cascade is a model trained with different input values. Additionally you shoud try to test the <a href="#" style="cursor: help;"  onclick="return false;" data-toggle="tooltip" title="The Sensitivity regulates how sensitive the used Framework OpenCV will classify a examined window as a face.">Sensitivity</a>
        at "1" and the <a href="#" style="cursor: help;"  onclick="return false;" data-toggle="tooltip" title="The Scale-Factor regulates how exact the used Framework OpenCV will examine the original image. E.g. the value 1.01 means, that a image pyramid will be build up in 1% steps.">Scale-Factor</a> at the lowest level possible.
        That causes the algorithm to detect way more False-Positives, but we want to be sure that your face will not be detected under most if not all circumstances.
        Thus you can be sure that your image will really be resistant against the Viola-Jones Framework. If your face gets detected through only one of the Cascades, please try a different convertion method.
        This method will not protect your image. More details and the used cascades can be fund here:

        <p><b>The size of your image should not exceed 5MB !</b></p>
        <p><b>Image convertion takes ~ 2 - 20 sec.</b></p>
